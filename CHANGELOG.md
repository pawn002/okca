This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed (breaking)
- `calculateContrast` renamed to `contrast` on both `OkcaService` and the convenience function — consistent with chroma.js, culori, and other color library conventions
- Parameters renamed from `textColor`/`bgColor` to `foreground`/`background` — argument order documents polarity intent
- Algorithm: polarity-aware model replaces symmetric ratio — `contrast(fg, bg) ≠ contrast(bg, fg)` when lightness differs; L-o-D cap 21, D-o-L cap 20
- Algorithm: green-hue correction (`K_DARK`) removed — pure OKLCH/Oklab model with no hue-specific patches

### Added
- CSS `oklab()` and `oklch()` string inputs (all CSS angle units supported for hue)
- Dual CJS + ESM build output with `exports` field for bundler and Node ESM compatibility
- New transform exports: `oklchToOklab`, `oklabToOklch`, `cssOklabToOklab`, `cssOklchToOklch`

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- README install command and import examples now use the correct scoped package name `@pawn002/okca`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- 3-digit hex shorthand support (`#fff`, `#f80`)
- GitHub Actions CI (Node 18/20/22) and npm publish on version tags

### Fixed
- README incorrectly claimed colorjs.io as a runtime dependency (it is zero-dependency)
- README incorrectly claimed support for CSS color strings beyond hex

## [0.0.1] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Initial release
- `calculateContrast(a, b)` convenience function
- `OkcaService` class with `calculateContrast` method
- Zero-dependency sRGB → Oklab/OKLCH transforms (`hexToSrgb`, `srgbToOklab`, `srgbToOklch`, `hexToOklab`, `hexToOklch`)
- OKLCH-native contrast algorithm with chroma compression and green-hue correction
- FP = 0 guarantee against WCAG 2.x
- 2,228 tests across 4 test suites
